**CBC-Chatbot**

I built a super simple chatbot that can direct the user to who can best answer their question based on what type of question it is.

It will identify if the person is asking a question or reporting a problem.
If they are reporting a problem, the chatbot will ask if it is a technical or operational question, then tell the user they have routed their question to the appropriate party.
If they are asking a question, it will determine dynamically if it's an operational or technical question, then direct the person to the person who can probably answer their question.
